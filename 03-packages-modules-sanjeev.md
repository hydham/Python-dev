# 🧩 Part 2 – Deep Dive into Modules & Packages

Alright — this time I’m diving deeper into how **Python modules and packages** really work.  
I already learned how to import my own files, but now I want to understand what’s actually happening behind the hood — especially when projects get bigger.

---

## 1. What Exactly Is a Module?

Any single `.py` file is already a **module**.  
If I create `helper.py`, that file itself is a module — even if it’s just one line of code.

When I import it from `main.py` like this:

    import helper

Python looks for `helper.py` in the same directory as `main.py`.  
Once found, it executes that file and creates a **namespace** for it.  
That’s why I must call things like `helper.add()` instead of just `add()`.

So importing doesn’t copy the code — it *loads* the module and gives me access to everything through its namespace.

---

## 2. Importing in Different Ways

I can import specific parts instead of the whole module:

    from helper import add, subtract

This lets me call them directly as `add()` or `subtract()`.

There’s also a wildcard import:

    from helper import *

That brings in *everything* except names starting with `_`.  
But it’s bad practice since it can cause name clashes — I’ll avoid this in real code.

---

## 3. Handling Name Conflicts with Aliases

Sometimes, two modules might define the same function name.  
To avoid overwriting, I can use **aliases**:

    from mod1 import test as mod1_test
    from mod2 import test as mod2_test

Or rename a whole module:

    import helper as hp

Now I can call `hp.add()` instead of `helper.add()`.  
This keeps names short and avoids confusion.

---

## 4. Conditional Imports

Python lets me import modules only when I need them.  
For example:

    x = 10
    if x > 5:
        import helper
        print(helper.add(x, 2))

I can also import inside a function so it only loads when the function runs.  
This helps reduce startup time in bigger programs.

---

## 5. Checking What’s in Scope with `dir()`

Calling `dir()` shows me all the names currently available.  
Before importing, I’ll only see built-ins.  
After `import helper`, I’ll see `helper` added.  
If I use `from helper import add`, then I’ll see `add` directly instead of `helper`.

It’s a simple but powerful way to see what’s currently in my namespace.

---

## 6. Modules That Can Run Themselves

Every `.py` file can be run directly.  
If I put a `print()` inside `helper.py` and then import it, that print still executes because Python runs the file once when importing.

To prevent that, I use:

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print("Running helper directly")

This code block only runs when I execute:

    python helper.py

and not when I import it elsewhere.  
It’s basically the standard “entry point” pattern for Python scripts.

---

## 7. Understanding Packages

As my code grows, I don’t want all `.py` files in one folder.  
That’s where **packages** come in — they’re just **folders that contain related Python modules**.

Example structure:

    database/
        mod1.py
        mod2.py

Now I can import like this:

    import database.mod1
    database.mod1.connect()

Packages are just folders — Python treats them as namespaces.  

In older Python versions, I needed an empty `__init__.py` file inside every package folder.  
Now it’s optional, but still a good idea to include one for clarity.

---

## 8. What `__init__.py` Does

When Python imports a package, it checks for an `__init__.py` file.  
If found, it runs that file **once** — like a “startup script” for the package.

    # database/__init__.py
    print("Database package loaded")

This file can also define what should be imported when someone uses `from database import *`.

---

## 9. Controlling Imports with `__all__`

When someone writes:

    from database import *

Python needs to know which modules to include.  
I can control that inside `database/__init__.py`:

    __all__ = ["mod1", "mod2"]

Now only those modules will be imported.  
It’s optional but helpful in large projects.  
The same rule works in a single file too — I can limit which functions get exported.

---

## 10. Sub-Packages and Relative Imports

Folders can contain other folders — these are **sub-packages**.

    utils/
        sub_package1/
            mod1.py
            mod2.py
        sub_package2/
            mod3.py

To import from one:

    import utils.sub_package1.mod1
    utils.sub_package1.mod1.func1()

Inside one module, I can import another in the same package using a **relative import**:

    from .mod2 import func2

Here, `.` means “current folder”.  
To go up one level, use two dots:

    from ..sub_package2.mod3 import func3

Once I thought of the dots like folder paths, everything made sense — absolute imports start from the top, relative imports start from where I am.

---

## 11. Running Modules with `python -m`

I used to get confused seeing `python -m`.  
Now I get it — it tells Python to **run a module as part of its package**, not as a loose file.

Example:

    python -m database.mod1

This runs `mod1.py` but keeps its package imports working.  
Inside, `__name__` becomes `"__main__"`, so the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block executes normally.

So the simple rule is:

- `python file.py` → run as a standalone script  
- `python -m package.module` → run as part of its package (so imports don’t break)

---

## 12. Running a Package Directly

A package can be run directly too — it just needs a `__main__.py` file.  
That’s the package’s “entry point.”

Example structure:

    database/
        __init__.py
        __main__.py
        mod1.py
        mod2.py

Example content of `__main__.py`:

    from database.mod1 import connect
    from database.mod2 import disconnect

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print("Running database package")
        connect()
        disconnect()

Then I can run it from the project root:

    python -m database

and Python will execute `database/__main__.py`.  

Sub-packages can work the same way — if `utils/sub_package1` has a `__main__.py`, I can run:

    python -m utils.sub_package1

to execute it.

If I only want a specific module:

    python -m utils.sub_package1.mod1

That runs `mod1.py` while still respecting package imports.

---

## 💡 Takeaway

After this deep dive, I finally have a mental map of how modules and packages behave.

- A **module** is any `.py` file.  
- A **package** is just a folder grouping related modules.  
- `__name__ == "__main__"` prevents unwanted code from running on import.  
- `__init__.py` runs once when the package loads.  
- `__all__` controls what wildcard imports bring in.  
- Dots in imports (`.`, `..`) act like folder paths.  
- `python -m` runs modules or packages in the correct, package-aware way.

Now the entire module system finally feels clear and logical.

# 🧩 Understanding `python -m` with Packages and Modules

I finally wanted to clear my confusion about what exactly happens when I use `python -m` — especially how it behaves differently for modules vs packages.

---

## 🧠 What `-m` Really Does

When I run a command like this:

    python -m something

it tells Python:

> “Run *something* as a module inside its package context, not as a plain file.”

This means Python sets up the **import path correctly**, so any relative imports like `from . import helper` will work.  
That’s all the “magic” behind `-m`. The difference depends on *what* that “something” actually is.

---

## 🧩 Case 1 – Running a Module

Example:

    python -m database.mod1

Step-by-step:

1. Python locates the `database` package.  
2. It executes `database/__init__.py` (because it has to import the package).  
3. Then it runs `database/mod1.py` as the main program.

So effectively:

- `database/__init__.py` is executed first.  
- `mod1.py` is executed as the script.  
- Inside `mod1.py`, `__name__` becomes `"__main__"`.

That’s why this works exactly like running the module directly, but with proper package context so that relative imports don’t break.

---

## 📦 Case 2 – Running a Package

Example:

    python -m database

What happens:

1. Python finds the `database` directory.  
2. It looks for a file named `__main__.py` inside that folder.  
3. It executes that file as the program.

So here:

- `__init__.py` runs first for package initialization.  
- Then `__main__.py` runs as the “main” entry point.  

If `__main__.py` doesn’t exist, Python throws an error:

    python: No module named database.__main__; 'database' is a package and cannot be directly executed

That’s why a runnable package **must** include a `__main__.py`.

---

## 📁 Case 3 – Just Importing Normally

When I do this in code:

    import database

Only `__init__.py` executes — nothing else.  
Because I’m not running anything, I’m just *loading* the package into memory.

---

## 🧱 Summary Table

| Command | Runs first | Executed as `__main__` | What it does |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|---------------|
| `python file.py` | — | `file.py` | Run a standalone script |
| `python -m package.module` | `package/__init__.py` | `package/module.py` | Run a module inside its package (keeps relative imports working) |
| `python -m package` | `package/__init__.py` | `package/__main__.py` | Run the package itself (its entry point) |
| `import package` | `package/__init__.py` | — | Only loads the package |

---

Now it finally makes sense:  

- `__init__.py` always runs when a package is imported or executed.  
- `__main__.py` only runs when a package is executed with `python -m package`.  
- For modules, Python runs the module file itself as `__main__`.  

That single distinction clears up the confusion between `__init__.py` and `__main__.py`.
